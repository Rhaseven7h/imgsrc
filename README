IMGSRC

====================================================

Tiny little scripts that loads a local HTML file or a remote
http web site page, and extracts the external (to the page's
domain) domains from which it is loading images.

Basically extracts all <IMG> tags and selects and sorts
external domains used to load images.

Accepts two parameters:

1. The first mandatory parameter is either the path to a local
file containing HTML to be parsed, or a URL to a web page to
be scanned.

2. The second optional parameter is --bare, which prevents the
script from outputting any extra info or interactivity so you
can use this prog in your own scripts.


Sample output:

As you can see the --bare makes the script not to ask
for ENTER to continue, also doesn't display any extra
formatting or information, so it can be used in
scripts. Also note the use of the script with local
files and http web sites.

Hope this is useful for someone out there, I am
currently using it to detect and auto add to a SQUID
server white list, the hosts from which an already
authorized page is loading images.
