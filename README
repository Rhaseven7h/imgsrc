IMGSRC

====================================================

Tiny little scripts that loads a local HTML file or a remote
http web site page, and extracts the external (to the page's
domain) domains from which it is loading images.

Basically extracts all <IMG> tags and selects and sorts
external domains used to load images.

See http://github.com/rha7dotcom/imgsrc/wikis for more details and usage.
